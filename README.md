# OpenThread-R21

A OpenThread Border Router firmware port for R21 based ConBee II and RaspBee II.  
**Note:** the port is still development, watch this repository to get notified when first beta test version is released.

* The firmware provides Thread Border Router that connects to Thread devices.
  This is the base which Thread based Matter devices built up on.
* The firmware can be flashed with GCFFlasher in the same way as deCONZ and ZShark firmware is flashed.
* Any deCONZ settings stored in NVRAM are preserved.
* The firmware is Thread only, it can't be used in parallel with Zigbee firmware (but switching the firmware is always possible).
